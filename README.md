# Autonomous Shooting Drone
## Introduction
Configure an autonomous shooting drone, using a DJI Phantom 2 drone, a raspberry 3 with 2 grovepis, multiple sensor from the grovepi kit, a gyroscope and a camera

## Goals
The Autonomous Shooting Drone purpose is to controll a DJI phantom2 drone with a Raspberry Pi 3, to make it takeoff, then stabilise it at 1.5 meter, then look for a person as a target, center the target and shoot with a BB gun. The Raspi is interfaced to the drone via the remote controller, which we replace the potentiometers by the raspberry's outputs
